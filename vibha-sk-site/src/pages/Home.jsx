                <h2>About me!</h2>
                <p>Iâ€™m a third-year undergraduate studying 
                    Electrical and Computer Engineering at the 
                    University of Washington. My engineering interests are in
                    radio frequency systems, wireless technologies,
                    VLSI, and embedded systems. Currently, I am an undergraduate 
                    researcher in UW's Sensor Systems Lab, 
                    advised by Dr. Joshua R Smith. </p>
                <br></br>
                <p>
                    With the desire to be involved on campus, I also became an Engineering Peer Educator (EPE) and 
                    Resident Advisor (RA) allowing me to engage with many different students and work alongside my peers
                    to foster a great UW community! 
                </p>
                <br></br>
                <p>
                    In my free time, I enjoy spending time with family and friends, reading, listening to new music, 
                    going on walks, visiting cafes, and bouldering! 
                </p>
